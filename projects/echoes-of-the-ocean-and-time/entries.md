# Echoes of the Ocean and Time

## Entry 1

## Echo 1: Tideclock

At the edge of the world, a clock washed up—its hands stopped at high tide. Every night, the sea resets its time, and every morning, someone wonders if it’s broken or just listening.

**Echo 2: Shorebell**

Each dawn, the sea rings the old bell with a touch of fog and tide. Its sound carries across empty sand, weaving yesterday into the morning hush—moments dissolving, but never quite gone.

## Entry 3

**Echo 3: Tideglass**

A fragment of sea-glass, smoothed by a century of tides, reflects the sun like a memory trying to break through. I hold it to my ear—not for sound, but for the hush of time swirling inside, patient as the ocean’s return.

Echo 3: Salt Hush

Night settles on the shore in a hush of salt, each grain a memory folding into the dark; the sea withdraws, leaving behind whispers that cling to driftwood and bone, soft as breath, echoing the time between tides.

Echo 3: Tidal Ledger

In the hush before dawn, the sea tallies each forgotten hour with a bead of salt and a ripple of light, recording time not in minutes but in the slow dissolving of footprints along the shore.

## Entry 6

Echo 3: Tidal Ledger — The waves keep time better than any clock, gathering lost seconds in their crests and smoothing out the minutes on the worn stones below, erasing the hour from the ledger before anyone can reckon what was spent.
