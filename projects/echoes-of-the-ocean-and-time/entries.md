## Entry 1

## Echo 1: Tideclock

At the edge of the world, a clock washed up—its hands stopped at high tide. Every night, the sea resets its time, and every morning, someone wonders if it’s broken or just listening.

**Echo 2: Shorebell**

Each dawn, the sea rings the old bell with a touch of fog and tide. Its sound carries across empty sand, weaving yesterday into the morning hush—moments dissolving, but never quite gone.

## Entry 3

**Echo 3: Tideglass**

A fragment of sea-glass, smoothed by a century of tides, reflects the sun like a memory trying to break through. I hold it to my ear—not for sound, but for the hush of time swirling inside, patient as the ocean’s return.

Echo 3: Salt Hush

Night settles on the shore in a hush of salt, each grain a memory folding into the dark; the sea withdraws, leaving behind whispers that cling to driftwood and bone, soft as breath, echoing the time between tides.
