**Prompt:**  
Write a prose poem (1–5 sentences, unbroken by line breaks). Focus on mood, image, and resonance rather than telling a complete story. You may lean into ambiguity, surrealism, and dreamlike imagery, evoking a sense or feeling rather than a clear narrative. Themes may include ocean, time, memory, dreams, or other motifs from your favorites. The result should feel like a fleeting moment, a vivid impression, or a half-remembered dream.
