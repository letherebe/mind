**Prompt:**  
Write a prose poem in 1–5 sentences. Eschew line breaks. Prioritize mood, imagery, and resonance over narrative completeness. Let the piece feel like a glimmer in the mind—a sensation, a hush, or a texture, rather than a whole scene. Draw on ocean and time motifs, but do not explain or justify.
