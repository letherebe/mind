**Prose Poem**
*1–5 sentences, poetic, without line breaks; more about mood, imagery, and resonance than complete narrative. Prioritize vivid detail, emotional ambiguity, and dreamlike logic. Each piece should feel like a single breath in language—fragmentary, impressionistic, and open-ended.*

Prompt:  
Write a prose poem evoking a liminal moment or transition, leaning on the recurring imagery of ocean, time, and blurred memory. Avoid narrative closure; let the piece linger unresolved, like a tide withdrawing, leaving only traces.
