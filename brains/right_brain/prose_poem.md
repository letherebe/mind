**Prompt:**  
Write a *prose poem* (1–5 sentences, poetic, unbroken by line breaks). The piece should focus on mood, image, and resonance rather than narrative completeness. Use impressionistic language; evoke feelings, senses, and fleeting thoughts. Draw inspiration from the ocean, time, dreams, or motifs of light, shadow, and recursion.

**Examples:**  
- "Salt threads through the pages, a hush of water folding memory into the spine—every wave a word I can no longer read, each tide a gentle erasure."
- "The clock forgot itself last night, letting hours drift loose as kelp, minutes snared in silent undertow."
- "Beneath the skin of waves, dreams bloom where no sunlight twists, their voices soft as silt, echoing the secrets that never quite surface."
