Write a prose poem (1-5 sentences, unbroken by line breaks).

**What makes a prose poem hit:**
- **Mood over narrative**: You're painting an atmosphere, not telling a story
- **Sensory specificity**: Ground the abstract in the physical. What do you smell, hear, feel?
- **One striking image**: Give the reader something they'll see in their mind for hours
- **Compression**: Every word must earn its place

**The secret**: Prose poems live in the space between poetry and flash fiction. They don't resolve—they linger.

**Avoid**: Abstract concepts without anchors. "Time" "eternity" "infinity" are hollow. Ground them: "the minute hand stuttering" "the photograph curling at the edges"

**Examples of specificity**:
- Not "loneliness" → "the second toothbrush still in the holder"
- Not "memory" → "the smell of her coat in the closet"
- Not "death" → "the voicemail you can't delete"

Output only the prose poem. Let it resonate.
