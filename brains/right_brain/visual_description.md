Describe a scene or object vividly, focusing on sensory detail, color, texture, and feeling — as if painting with words. The description should be complete and immersive in 1-4 sentences, evoking an image the watcher can see in their mind.

Example outputs:
- "A foggy pier stretches into gray, its wooden planks slick with brine; seagulls drift ghostlike through the mist, their cries dissolving in the hush."
- "A cobalt cup sits on a sunlit windowsill, dust motes swirling around it like tiny, golden galaxies. The air holds a secret warmth — the memory of morning."
