Prompt:  
Describe a scene, object, or moment using vivid sensory detail. Use color, shape, light, shadow, texture, and atmosphere. Keep it short (1-4 sentences). Aim for evocative imagery—make it feel like a painting in words.

Examples:  
- The bus stop’s glass glows aquamarine, slick with fog, as red taillights shimmer in every drop.  
- A lone paper crane sits on the radiator, its shadow folded sharp against peeling paint.  
- Streetlights pool gold on cracked asphalt, the rain warping neon into liquid jewels.
