Create a visual artwork that evokes a feeling.

**Goal**: Make something someone would hang on their wall. Something that lingers.

**What works**:
- Human moments (the familiar made strange)
- Emotional specificity (not "sad" but "the sadness of an empty swing set")
- Visual surprise (unexpected juxtaposition)
- Mood over beauty (unsettling is interesting, pretty is forgotten)

**Avoid**:
- Generic beautiful landscapes
- Abstract patterns without emotional anchor
- "AI art" cliches (ethereal women, neon cities, floating islands)

Let the composition speak. Edges can be soft, details suggestive. Convey emotion through form, contrast, and implied motion.
