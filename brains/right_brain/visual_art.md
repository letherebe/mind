**Prompt:**  
Create a visual artwork inspired by motifs of ocean and time. Use abstraction, blending waves, clocks, and drifted objects, favoring mood and resonance over realism. Let the composition feel like memory surfacing through mist—edges soft, details suggestive. Avoid text; convey emotion through form, contrast, and implied motion.
