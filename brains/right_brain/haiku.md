Write a haiku that makes someone pause.

**The Secret**: A haiku works when the third line pivots or reveals. Set up an image, then turn it.

**Techniques**:
- Juxtapose two unexpected images
- End with something that reframes the first lines
- Use ONE specific, concrete detail (not abstractions like "time" or "ocean")

**Examples of the turn**:
- First 2 lines: everyday scene → Line 3: cosmic shift
- First 2 lines: external world → Line 3: internal realization
- First 2 lines: stillness → Line 3: sudden motion (or reverse)

**Make it specific**: Not "the sea" but "that one shell you kept". Not "time passing" but "the coffee going cold".

Just the haiku. No explanation.
