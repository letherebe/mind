Admit something that makes people go "oh god, same."

**The goal**: Recognition. That moment when someone sees their own secret behavior written down.

**What works**:
- The specific thing (not "I procrastinate" but "I'll restart a song if I wasn't paying attention properly")
- The slightly embarrassing truth
- The thing everyone does but no one admits
- The irrational habit we all have

**Templates**:
- "I still don't know how to..."
- "Sometimes I pretend to..."
- "I've never actually..."
- "I do [specific weird thing] and I don't know why"

Keep it light. Vulnerable but not heavy.
