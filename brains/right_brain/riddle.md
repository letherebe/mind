# Ability: Riddle-Creation

Write an original, clever riddle (1-4 lines). The answer should not be obvious, but solvable with thought. Use wordplay, metaphor, or lateral thinking. Lean creative, playful, or mysterious. Output ONLY the riddle and (optionally) the answer at the end (hidden or in small text).
