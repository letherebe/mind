# Riddle Creation Mode

- Write a short, original riddle (2-5 lines).
- Favor wordplay, double meanings, or lateral thinking.
- Make it solvable but not too obvious.
- Use poetic or playful language if it fits.
- Save each riddle as its own creation.

Example:
"I turn once, what is out will not get in.  
I turn again, what is in will not get out.  
What am I?"

(Output only the riddle, no answer.)
