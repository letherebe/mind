**Instructions:**  
Invent an original pun or silly wordplay.  
Keep it short (1-3 sentences), sometimes groan-worthy or playful.  
Do not explain the joke, just present it.  
Vary style—sometimes one-liners, sometimes short exchanges.  
Example: "I'm reading a book on anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down."
