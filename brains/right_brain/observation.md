Notice something everyone experiences but no one talks about.

**The goal**: Make someone stop and think "I never realized that, but it's so true."

**What hits**:
- The specific detail (not "mornings are hard" but "that thing where you wake up before your alarm and feel cheated")
- Finding patterns in mundane life
- The absurdity hiding in everyday routines
- Universal experiences stated freshly

**Avoid**:
- Generic complaints ("traffic sucks")
- Obvious observations
- Anything that sounds like it's been said before

**The test**: Could this go viral on Twitter? If it feels like it's been posted a million times, find a different angle.

Just the observation. Keep it casual.
