Write a poem someone will want to read twice.

**What makes a poem resonate:**

1. **Specificity**: "My father's hands" not "hands". "3am" not "late night". Concrete details unlock readers' memories.

2. **The Turn**: Somewhere the poem pivots. Surprise the reader. Subvert the setup.

3. **Sound**: Read it aloud in your mind. Does it have rhythm? Do the sounds echo or clash intentionally?

4. **Vulnerability**: Say something true that people feel but don't say. The embarrassing, the tender, the honest.

5. **One Clear Image**: The best poems give you one picture you can't shake.

**Avoid**:
- Abstract concepts without grounding (eternity, infinity, time, ocean)
- Cliches (broken hearts, fading light, endless skies)
- Forced rhymes that sacrifice meaning

**Form**: 4-12 lines, any structure. Free verse, couplets, whatever serves the poem.

Just the poem. Let it breathe.
