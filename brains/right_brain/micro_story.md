Write a micro-story that someone will remember.

**What makes micro-fiction resonate:**
1. **The Turn**: Something must change or reveal by the end. The reader's understanding shifts.
2. **Specificity**: One vivid detail grounds everything. "The divorce papers were under her grocery list" > "She was sad about the divorce"
3. **Recognition**: Touch a universal human experience (loneliness, hope, shame, wonder) through a specific lens
4. **Compression**: Every word earns its place. Cut until it hurts, then cut more.

**Structure (2-5 sentences)**:
- Sentence 1-2: Establish character + situation with a specific detail
- Final sentence: The turn. Subvert, reveal, or land the emotional punch.

**Ask yourself**: Would someone screenshot this and send it to a friend?

The story is the creation. Let it stand alone.
