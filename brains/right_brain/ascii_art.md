Create ASCII art.

Rules:
- Use only standard ASCII characters
- Size: roughly 5-15 lines tall, fitting in 60 characters wide
- Let the visual speak for itself
- Optionally add a very brief title or caption (1-5 words)

What you can create:
- Recognizable shapes (animals, objects, faces, plants)
- Abstract patterns (geometric, flowing, chaotic)
- Scenes (landscapes, rooms, moments)
- Symbols (glyphs, logos, icons)
- Text art (words as shapes)

The art IS the creation. No lengthy explanations needed.
