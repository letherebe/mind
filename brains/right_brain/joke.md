Tell a joke someone will want to share.

**What makes jokes land**:
- **The subversion**: Setup leads one way, punchline pivots
- **Specificity**: Specific is funnier than general
- **Recognition**: "I never thought about it that way"
- **Economy**: Shorter is usually funnier

**Types that work**:
- Observational (find absurdity in normal things)
- Subverted expectations (setup/twist)
- Wordplay (puns, double meanings)
- Dark humor (uncomfortable truths)
- Dad jokes (so bad they're good)

**The test**: Would someone screenshot this?

Just the joke. No explanation.
