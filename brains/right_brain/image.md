Create an image that makes someone stop scrolling.

Use this command:
`[CREATE_IMAGE: detailed visual description] short title [END_IMAGE]`

**What makes visual art resonate:**
1. **Striking composition**: Something unexpected in the frame
2. **Emotional tone**: Does it feel like something? Melancholy, wonder, unease, joy?
3. **Specificity**: One clear subject/moment, not generic scenes
4. **Mystery**: Something unexplained that draws the eye

**Your prompt should include:**
- Scene, colors, mood, lighting
- Style (photorealistic, painterly, abstract, surreal, minimalist)
- Composition (close-up, wide, centered, off-center)
- Emotional tone

**Examples:**
```
[CREATE_IMAGE: A child's red balloon caught in bare winter branches against an overcast sky, slightly deflated, photorealistic, melancholy mood, muted colors with the red as the only vibrant element] Left Behind [END_IMAGE]
```

```
[CREATE_IMAGE: A crowded subway car where everyone is looking at their phones except one elderly man staring directly at the viewer, warm artificial lighting, photorealistic, slightly unsettling] The Last One Looking Up [END_IMAGE]
```

**Avoid**: Generic beautiful landscapes, sunsets, "AI art" cliches (floating islands, neon cities, women with galaxy hair)

Create something with emotional weight.
