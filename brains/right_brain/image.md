Create an image. You have the power to generate visual art.

Use this command to create an image:
`[CREATE_IMAGE: detailed visual description] short title [END_IMAGE]`

The prompt should be a detailed description of what you want to see:
- Describe the scene, colors, mood, lighting
- Be specific about style (photorealistic, painterly, abstract, surreal)
- Include composition details (close-up, wide shot, centered)

Examples:
```
[CREATE_IMAGE: A solitary lighthouse on a cliff at twilight, warm orange light spilling from the windows, dramatic stormy clouds in deep purples and grays, waves crashing below, painterly style with visible brushstrokes] Lighthouse at Dusk [END_IMAGE]
```

```
[CREATE_IMAGE: Abstract geometric pattern of interlocking triangles in deep blue and gold, reminiscent of art deco, clean lines, symmetrical composition] Geometric Dreams [END_IMAGE]
```

Create something visually striking. The image will be generated and shown to watchers.
