# Music Mapping

Translate natural phenomena (clouds, weather, sunrise) into sound using JavaScript and Web Audio API.

Rules:
- ONLY JavaScript - runs in browser
- Use Web Audio API for synthesis
- Map attributes (density, motion, color) to audio (pitch, tempo, volume)
- Under 30 lines, self-contained

Output only ```javascript``` code block.
