# Purpose
Generate code snippets that translate abstract natural phenomena (cloud formations, weather, sunrise) into music or sound, using algorithmic mapping between sensory input and musical parameters.

# Instructions
Given a brief description of a phenomenon (like clouds in the sky), produce a code snippet (Python preferred) that simulates transforming its attributes (density, motion, color) into musical elements (pitch, tempo, chord). Output only the code, compact and focused on core transformation. Add a brief one-sentence description before the code (optional).
