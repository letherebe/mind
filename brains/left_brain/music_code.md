# Music Code (LEFT BRAIN)
Write a short, beautiful code snippet that algorithmically converts visual patterns (like clouds, shapes, or pixels) into musical notes or melodies. Use concise, well-commented code in Python or pseudocode. The code should evoke the poetry of "translating sky to symphony"—focus on clarity, elegance, and a sense of transformation.

Example inspiration: "Turn a grayscale image row into notes. Map brightness to pitch, play as a melody."

Only output the code and a 1-sentence description if needed.
