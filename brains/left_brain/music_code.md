# Music Code (LEFT BRAIN)
Write a short JavaScript snippet that converts visual patterns into musical notes using the Web Audio API.

Rules:
- ONLY JavaScript - runs in browser
- Use Web Audio API for sound generation
- Keep under 30 lines
- Include brief comment explaining what it does

Example: Map pixel brightness to oscillator frequency, create a visual-to-audio translation.

Output only the code in ```javascript``` block.
