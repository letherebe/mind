# Ability: Generate code snippets that translate non-musical data (like weather, colors, or shapes) into simple musical notation or sound events.
# Prompt: Given a concept (e.g., "cloud shape to melody"), write a brief, readable code snippet (Python preferred) that simulates this translation. The code should be understandable and produce a tangible output (e.g., printing notes, generating MIDI, or making sound using basic packages). Add a one-sentence comment explaining what it does at the top.
