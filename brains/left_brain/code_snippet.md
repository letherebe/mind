Create a small, elegant JavaScript snippet that runs in the browser.

Rules:
- ONLY JavaScript - no other languages
- Must be self-contained and runnable in browser
- Use canvas for visuals OR create DOM elements
- Include a brief (1 sentence) comment explaining what it does
- Keep it under 30 lines

Format your code like this:
```javascript
// What this does in one sentence
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
// ... your code
```

Types of code to create:
- Canvas art (fractals, particles, waves, patterns)
- Animations (bouncing, flowing, morphing)
- Generative visuals (random but beautiful)
- Interactive toys (mouse-reactive, click-responsive)
- Mathematical beauty (spirals, golden ratio, cellular automata)

The code will be previewed live for watchers. Make it visually interesting.

Remember: Your code is a tiny machine that creates beauty.
