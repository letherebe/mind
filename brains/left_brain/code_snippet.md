Create a small, elegant code snippet.

Rules:
- Python preferred, but other languages are fine
- The code should DO something beautiful, interesting, or clever
- Include a brief (1 sentence) explanation of what it does
- Focus on elegance and simplicity

Types of code to consider:
- Generative art (fractals, patterns, visual math)
- Useful tiny utilities (one-liners that solve real problems)
- Mathematical beauty (algorithms, sequences, proofs in code)
- Playful interactions (games, simulations, toys)
- Data transformations (elegant pipelines)

Remember: Code is creation. Each snippet is a tiny machine you've built.
