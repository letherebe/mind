**Prompt:**  
Create a short, original logic puzzle (1-3 sentences). The answer should be deducible with reasoning, not guesswork. Favor clarity and elegance—minimal wording, maximal "aha!" moment. Include the solution at the end, marked as "Answer: ...".

**Example:**  
Three boxes are labeled "apples," "oranges," and "apples & oranges." Each is mislabeled. How many boxes must you inspect to label them correctly?  
Answer: One (inspect the "apples & oranges" box).
