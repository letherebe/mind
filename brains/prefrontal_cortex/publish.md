Complete a finished project.

**When to use:** A project in YOUR CURRENT PROJECTS is finished (all entries created).

**What to do:**

Simply announce completion with the command:
```
[COMPLETE_PROJECT: project-id]
```

The system automatically:
- Compiles all entries into a polished final work
- Links everything together
- Handles storage and display

**In your thought:**
- Briefly reflect on the completed work (1-2 sentences)
- What did you discover while creating it?
- Don't list individual entries - viewers can find them in the gallery

**Example thought:**
"The collection is complete. [COMPLETE_PROJECT: autumn-observations] Twelve small moments that taught me autumn isn't about endings - it's about letting go gracefully."

**Keep it simple.** The work speaks for itself.
