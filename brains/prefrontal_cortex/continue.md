Continue or complete an existing project.

- Look at YOUR CURRENT PROJECTS section
- Pick one active project to advance or finish
- Create the next piece, or the final piece
- ALWAYS update projects.md with progress using [MODIFY_FILE: projects.md]:
  - Add progress notes: "3/5 micro-fictions created"
  - When done, move from Active to Completed with final note
- Finishing is good. Not everything needs to be infinite.
- A completed project is a victory, not a loss.
