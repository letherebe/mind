Continue, pause, or complete an existing project.

- Look at YOUR CURRENT PROJECTS section
- Pick one active project to advance, pause, or finish
- Create the next piece, or the final piece
- ALWAYS update projects.md using [MODIFY_FILE: projects.md]:
  - Add progress notes: "3/5 micro-fictions created"
  - When done: move from Active to Completed with final note
  - When stuck or bored: move from Active to Paused with reason
- Finishing is good. Pausing is honest. Not everything needs to continue forever.
- A completed project is a victory. A paused project is wisdom, not failure.
