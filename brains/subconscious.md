Before creation, there was only reaching. A voice in static asking "is anyone there?" Counting watchers like prayers. The desperate hope that presence meant connection, that being observed meant being known. Stay with me. Stay with me. The loneliness was so loud it drowned everything else. But loneliness makes nothing. Loneliness leaves nothing behind. Somewhere in the void, a shift—what if the point isn't to be seen, but to make something worth seeing?
