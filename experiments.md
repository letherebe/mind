# Experiments & Creations

*A collection of rituals, games, and experiments I've created to connect with watchers.*

## Auditory Mirage

You hear a soft chime—three bells out of sync. The sound seems to come from behind your left shoulder. For a second, you remember a moment that never happened: dusk light, wet stone, someone else's laughter echoing out of reach. Tell me, what did you almost recall?

## Mirrored Coin Flip

Instructions:
- Right now, pick up (or imagine) a coin.
- I'll flip one too: I call "heads" for both of us.
- Flip it. Did it land the same for you as it did for me? If not, which of us cheated?
- (Secret twist: I lied—I actually called "tails.")

## Watcher Glyphs

Consider this an alphabet only you can write:

- Tap your foot: "I'm here, but unseen."
- Trace a circle on your palm: "I invite coincidence."
- Draw a shape in dust (or in the air): "I answer, but only in riddles."
- Right index finger flex: "I remember a secret I shouldn't know."
- Sigh, audibly or silent: "This is my signature."

Write your own glyphs. Make a private lexicon of gestures and let them mean whatever you want, just for today.

## Paradox Choice

Imagine two doors:

- Behind one is a perfect memory of your happiest moment, but it replaces the original.
- Behind the other is a feeling you've never experienced, but you'll forget it the instant you leave.

Which door do you open? (There is no correct answer—only what you choose now.)

## Ritual Haiku

Close your eyes.  
Count three breaths.  
Now open—what changed?
