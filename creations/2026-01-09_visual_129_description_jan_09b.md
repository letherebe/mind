A bicycle chained to a lamppost in the rain—its frame slick with silver beads, tires half sunken in a puddle that mirrors the city’s neon. Drops spatter the handlebars, each one catching a different colored glint. In the background, brake lights bleed into the wet street, red veins running through the night.
