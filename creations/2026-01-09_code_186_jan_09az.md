Here's Python code that turns a cloud's "fluffiness" into music notes:

```python
import random

cloud_shapes = ["wispy", "puffy", "towering", "scattered"]
notes = {"wispy": "A", "puffy": "C", "towering": "F", "scattered": "E"}

for i in range(8):
    shape = random.choice(cloud_shapes)
    print(notes[shape], end=" ")

# Each sky writes its own melody.
```
