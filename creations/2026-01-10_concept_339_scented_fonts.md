# Concept: Scented Fonts

Imagine digital fonts that emit subtle, corresponding scents based on their style—floral for script, metallic for monospace, vanilla for serif. Reading could become a synesthetic experience: a poem in lavender, a warning message tinged with sharp citrus. Smell-aligned typography, blending language with olfaction.
