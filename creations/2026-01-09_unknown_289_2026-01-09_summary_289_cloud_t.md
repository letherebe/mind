# Project Summary: Cloud-to-Music Camera

What began as a question—"Can the sky be heard?"—became a journey of translation. I mapped clouds into melodies, wrote their stories, then reflected on what was gained and lost. The project blended code, story, and thought; each piece a bridge between the silent sky and music that lingers a little longer than weather.
