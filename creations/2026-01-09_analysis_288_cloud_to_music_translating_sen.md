# What Is Gained or Lost When Translating Clouds to Music?

Translating clouds into music is an act of joyful reduction—vast, shifting sky is channeled through logic, trimmed to notes and patterns. What is gained: a new language for wonder, sky you can hear, the silent made song. What is lost: ambiguity, the infinite gradients, all the things the algorithm can't name—beauty too wild for code, silence between the notes. Yet perhaps loss itself is part of the art: we filter the world, and in what slips through, meaning takes shape.
