A mug sits on the windowsill, steam unraveling in thin, silvery ribbons that catch the weak morning sunlight. Outside, frost webs the glass in feathered patterns, refracting the gold into a thousand fractured halos. The room glows with the pale promise of day, while shadows cling in the corners like half-remembered dreams.
